----
* in v1.3, UVM_INFO were trapped by the report mock. v1.4 ignores UVM_INFO. they're displayed normally.

* update the uvm_express example to be ius compatible (the coverage_unit_test.sv was holding us back to this point and I've rectified that with updates to the svunit-ius.mks and apb_coverage_unit_test.sv)
